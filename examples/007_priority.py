"""
In this example, we will impose an ordering of the computations so that some
parameter get computed before other.
To do so, we will adapt the `001_basic_usage.py` example.

Concretely, we will impose that the computations for x=3 be done in priority.
One could also impose a priority for other parameters or event for another value
of the same parameters.

:cls:`PrioritizedParamSet` is a decorator class for `ParameterSet`. At
creation, it takes a `ParameterSet` to whom/which it delegates all the basic
resposabilites (generating the cartesian product of the parameters, adding
separators (see `004_adding_parameter_values.py` and
`005_adding_parameters.py`), etc.). It offers the possibility to change the
ordering of the computations through its method :meth:`prioritize`.

Note one can change the priority even once some computations have already
run with another (possibly the default) priority. Isn't it nice ?

The workflow is the following:
  1. Create a :cls:`PrioritizedParamSet` that takes the regular
     :cls:`ParameterSet` at creation
  2. Use its :meth:`prioritize` method to -- ok you've guessed it

Run the following command lines:
`python 000_reset.py` to reset the 'BasicUsage' experiment
`python 007_priority.py front-end --capacity 2` to run the three firsts
    computations
See from the logging output (debug level) how the only two launched computations
are the ones with x=3.
