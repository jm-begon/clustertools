"""
This minimum working example illustrate the use of `Clustertools` to run
a simple experiment. The (dummy) experiment consist in computing the
multiplication and addition of several numbers. More specifically, we will
compute x*y and z+w for x in [1, 2, 3], y = 2, z = 4, w in [5, 6].

To test the code, do `python 001_basic_usage.py front-end`.

You can choose an other backend than `front-end` It must be one of:
debug, front-end, bash, slurm.

Note that you might not be able to use some backend. For instance, Slurm might
not be installed. Use `python 001_basic_usage.py -h` to see the help. There is
also some help and specific parameters for each back end. Check them out with
`python 001_basic_usage.py <backend> -h`

Enjoy!
