"""
This minimum working example illustrate the use of `Clustertools` to run
a simple experiment. The (dummy) experiment consist in computing the
multiplication and addition of several numbers. More specifically, we will
compute x*y and z+w for x in [1, 2, 3], y = 2, z = 4, w in [5, 6].

The computation will be done in the current process, purely sequentially.
