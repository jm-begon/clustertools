Examples
========
The example files depict some features of Clustertools.
 
The file `000_reset.py` reset the `BasicUsage` pseudo-experiment use throughout 
the examples.

The `001_basic_usage.py`, `003_custom_arguments.py`, 
`004_adding_parameter_values.py`, `005_adding_parameters.py`, 
`006_constraints.py`, `007_priority.py` illustrate some features related to the
launch of the experiments. The rely on the `CTParser` class which provide a
standard parser. In require the environment/backend to be specify and accepts
additional parameters. See `001_basic_usage.py` for more information.

The `002_result.py` and `005_results_with_default_params.py` illustrate some
features of the analysis part. 

The headers and comments of those files should help you master Clustertools.
