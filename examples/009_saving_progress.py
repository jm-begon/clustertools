"""
Clustertools offers the possibility to save partial results. This is handy with
long computations that can get interrupted (by a job scheduler like Slurm for
instance).

You just need to use the :meth:`save_result` method from the `Computation`
class.

So far, there is no way to restart a interrupted computation from the last save
point. Pull requests are welcome(d)

To run this example, open two terminals. In the first one, run this example
(`python 009_saving_progress.py front-end`). In the second, do
`python 009_partial_results.py`. Every few seconds, you should see advances
in the root precision
