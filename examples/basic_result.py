"""
This minimum working examples illustrate the use of `Clustertools` `Datacube`.
You should have run the `basic_bash.py` example BEFOREHAND, otherwise there will
be no data to analyze.

The experiment consisted in computing the multiplication and addition of
several numbers. More specifically, we will compute x*y and z+w
for x in [1, 2, 3], y = 2, z = 4, w in [5, 6].
